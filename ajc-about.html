            <h2>ABOUT</h2>

            <p>Hi everyone.  My name is Amie Johnson.  I am a digital artist living in North Carolina.  I specialize in creating characters and humanoid creatures.  Mainly portrait and full-body illustrations.  I also dabble in landscapes and random bird paintings every now and then.</p>

            <p>I have always been interested in art of all kinds ever since I can remember.  I became serious about pursuing digital painting in 2012.  I graduated college in 2013 with an Associates Degree as well as some Certificates in Simulation and Game Development with a focus on 3d modeling.  I love 3d modeling, but I felt like I was at a dead end with no where to go so after college ended I decided to switch gears and start focusing on developing my digital painting skills full time and try to make a name for myself.</p>

            <p><strong>“PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE” <!-- I tell myself this everyday. --></strong></p>

            <p>I am a self-taught artist/digital painter.  I originally went for a more realistic rendered style, but at the beginning of 2016 I became interested in a cel-shaded comic style.  I practiced with that style for a while, but soon realized I missed my realistic rendering style.  So I set out to combine the two styles and have arrived at a style that I am very happy with.  This art journey has been amazing so far and I can’t wait to see what my art will evolve into over years to come.</p>
